# Configuration Management with Ansible

## Overview

Configuration management is a critical aspect of modern software development and IT operations. It involves maintaining the desired state of systems, applications, and infrastructure, ensuring consistency, reliability, and efficiency. Effective configuration management allows teams to automate the deployment and management of their environments, reducing the risk of human error and improving overall productivity.

## Why Ansible?

We chose Ansible for our configuration management needs due to its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful automation capabilities. Ansible uses a declarative language, making it easy to understand and write playbooks. Its agentless architecture allows for quick setup and minimal overhead, enabling us to manage our infrastructure without the need for additional software installations on target machines. Additionally, Ansible's extensive community and rich ecosystem of modules provide us with the tools we need to automate a wide range of tasks.
